‎ ‎ ‎ ‎‎ ‎ ‎  You know when you're working and all of a sudden you're like, "Nah, screw this time to (doom)scroll on TikTok/Youtube/Vine"? It's bad for you, and this could mean you're getting more and more work and falling further and further behind. When this happens, a part of your brain fails to load/process the info that you are trying to A. Study or B. Work on something, I like to work with complete silence, and it works for 1-2 hours. And these apps that claim that their app can help you focus is complete bogus. And even when it sometimes works, it's not as long as they claim. For example, Brain.FM claims 4h of complete focus, but after 5 minutes, I could not focus at all. I resorted to doomscrolling instead. Now with the programs that I like, I focus for MORE than 4h and get more and more work done. all the apps that **CLAIM** that their app works **NEVER** does.
